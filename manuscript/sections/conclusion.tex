\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have investigated how crowds of security researchers hunt software bugs and vulnerabilities. We have found that it is essential for managers to design their program, in order to attract and enroll the largest possible number of security researchers. This results stems for the large deviation of contributions per researchers: Increasing the crowd therefore increases the chance to sample a researcher capable of achieving a large number of bug discoveries. Studying the incentive structure of 35 public bug bounty programs launched at a rate of one per month over 2 years, we have found that security researchers have high incentives to rush to newly launched programs, in order to scoop rewards from numerous easy bugs, and as the program ages (and therefore, the probability of finding a vulnerability decreases), switch to another newer ``easier" program. Our results suggest that incentives are not generously set by program managers, but rather that it is quickly getting harder for researchers to find vulnerabilities, once the obvious ones have been discovered.
