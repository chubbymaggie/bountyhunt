\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have investigated how crowds of security researchers hunt bounties for software bugs and vulnerabilities on a major bug bounty program platform. We have found that it is essential for managers to design their program, in order to attract and enroll the largest possible number of security researchers. This results stems for the large deviation of contributions per researchers: Increasing the crowd therefore increases the chance to sample a researcher capable of achieving a large number of bug discoveries. Studying the incentive structure of 35 public bug bounty programs launched at a rate of one per months over 2 years, we have found that security researchers have high incentives to rush in order to scoop rewards from numerous easy bugs, and as the program ages (and therefore, the probability of finding a vulnerability decreases), switch to a newer ``easier" program. Our results suggest that incentives are not generously set by program managers, but rather that it is just quickly getting harder to find vulnerabilities, once the obvious ones have been discovered.
