\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
The vulnerability discovery process in a bug bounty program is driven by the probability to find an additional bug given that $k$ bugs have already been discovered (i.e., the exhaustion process), and program managers aim to maximize $n$, the total number of bugs found. Our results show that the number of bugs discovered is a super-linear function of security researchers who have enrolled in the program (see Figure \ref{fig:scaling}{\bf A}). While bounty programs benefit from the work of a large number of researchers, researchers overall benefit from diversifying their efforts across programs (see Figure \ref{fig:ccdf_count_bounties}). This benefit is particularly tangible regarding the cumulative reward they can extract from their bug hunting activity. In particular, we illustrate how researchers take the strategic decision to enroll on a newly launched program, at the expense of existing ones. We observe that behaviors seem to contradict rational behavior dictated by the expected utility function, characterized by a structure comparable to the St. Petersburg.
 
\subsection{Security researcher enrollment is determinant for the success of a bug bounty program}
As presented on Figure \ref{fig:scaling}A, we find that the number $n$ of bounties discovered scales as $n \sim h^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = 1.10(3)$ and $h$ the number of security researchers enrolled in a program. Since $\alpha > 1$, a bounty program benefits in a super-linear fashion from the enrollment of more researchers. This result is reminiscent of productive bursts and critical cascades of contributions in open source software development \cite{sornette2014much}: Each enrollment (i.e., {\it mother} event) initiates a cascade of vulnerability discoveries (i.e., {\it daughter} events) by the security researcher. Over all participants, the more productive these cascades, the better. The total amount of bug discoveries within a program is a random variable governed by a power law tail distribution of security researchers enrolled with exponent $1< \gamma = 1.16(4) < 2$ (see Figure \ref{fig:scaling}B), and by the {\it fertility} of researchers' investigations (not shown here). In case of critical fertility, i.e., if on average $1$ discovery leads to $1$ follow-up discovery, the distribution of the sum of bug discoveries follows a power law tail distribution with exponent $\mu = 1/\gamma$ \cite{sornette2014much}. Here, we find that $\mu = 0.79(4) \approx 1/1.16 = 0.86(4)$ in reasonably good accordance with the theory  (see Figure \ref{fig:scaling}B).\\

\begin{figure}[Ht]

\caption{ {\bf A.}  The number of bounty discoveries $B_c$ scales as $~h^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = 1.10(3)$ and $h$ the number of security researchers enrolled in a program. Since $\alpha > 1$, a bounty programs benefits in a super-linear fashion to the enrollment of more researchers. {\bf B.} The tail distribution of bounty discoveries follows a power law distribution $P(X>x) \sim 1/x^\mu$  with $\mu = 0.79(4) < 1$, with no statistical moment defined (in particular no mean and no variance defined). Thus, from {\bf A.} and {\bf B.} combined and unless a hard limit exists, the number of vulnerabilities which can be found is only limited by the number of researchers enrolled in the program. Furthermore, each additional researcher brings a marginally increasing chance to find a lot more bounties.}

Since the tail distribution of bounty discoveries follows a power law distribution $P(X>x) \sim 1/x^\mu$  with $\mu = 0.79(4) < 1$, no statistical moment is defined (in particular neither the mean nor the variance defined). Therefore, we can expect that in the future some bounty programs will lead to the discovery of arbitrary large numbers $n$ of bugs. And this large $n$ is controlled by the number of enrolled researchers: The intuition is simply that the more researchers are enrolled, the more likely a particularly productive researcher will be sampled. This highly skewed productivity may result from previously acquired skills, fast endogenous learning, pure chance, or perhaps a combination of multiple factors.
 
\subsection{Security researchers are incentivized to diversify their contributions across bug bounty programs}
From the perspective of a security researcher, the governing metric is primarily the number of vulnerabilities found by herself or over a whole bounty program, but rather the expected payoff from the accumulation of bounty awards. This expected utility is governed by the probability to find a number of vulnerabilities and their associated payoff, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:method}. To fully understand the incentive mechanisms at work, we consider 3 perspectives: it is interesting to study (i) the expected cumulative down-payment made by bug bounty program managers (see Figure \ref{fig:scalings_awards}{\bf A}), the expected cumulative payoff from the viewpoint of a researcher for (ii) one program (see Figure \ref{fig:scalings_awards}{\bf B}), and for (iii) all programs (see Figure \ref{fig:scalings_awards}{\bf C}).\\


\begin{figure}[Ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/scalings_awards.eps}
\caption{{\bf A.} (Log-)binned cumulative down-payment (in US dollars) per program over all public programs on HackerOne platform, scales as $R_{k} \sim k^{1.27}$ ($ p < 0.001$, $R^2 > 0.99$). Each log-bin shows the mean value and the circle sizes depict the number of values in each bin (i.e., the rank frequency). The super-linear {\it scaling} relationship between the cumulative reward and the rank shows that reward increases as a function of $k$. However, the frequency of bounties $P_k$ is only slightly upwards trended increasing as $ \sim k^{0.13}$ ($ p < 0.001$, $R^2 = 0.40$). {\bf B.} Considering the opposite figure from the viewpoint of researcher's expected payoff when enrolling in a single bug bounty program, the super-linear effect is much stronger ($R_{k} \sim k^{1.40}$ with $ p < 0.001$ and $R^2 > 0.99$). However, the frequency decays following a power law of the form $P_{k} \sim k^{-1.85}$ ($ p < 0.001$, $R^2 = 0.97$). {\bf C.} Over all bug bounty programs, security researchers have another expected payoff: the reward scaling is smaller ($R_{k} \sim k^{1.24}$ with $ p < 0.001$, $R^2 > 0.99$), yet the frequency of bounties decay much slower as a function of rank $P_{k} \sim k^{-1.05}$ ($ p < 0.001$, $R^2 = 0.85$).}
\label{fig:scalings_awards}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The average cumulative down-payment (in US dollars) per program exhibits a super-linear scaling as $\sim k^{1.27}$ ($ p < 0.001$, $R^2 > 0.99$), while the frequency of bounties $P_k$ is only slightly upwards trended increasing as $ \sim k^{0.13}$ ($ p < 0.001$, $R^2 = 0.40$). The expected down-payment by bug bounty program managers scales as $\sim k^{1.40}$, which is a considerable super-linear increase, as $k \rightarrow \infty$, and even casts question on the long-term sustainability of bug bounty programs. \\

From the viewpoint of the researcher, the expected payoff for a single bug bounty program, the increase of average cumulative reward ($R_{k} \sim k^{1.40}$) does not offset the fast decay of probability to find a vulnerability of rank $k$ ($P_{k} \sim k^{-1.85}$). The expected payoff therefore follows $\sim k^{-0.45}$, which clearly does not bring high incentives to explore in depth a bug bounty program. It is important to note however, that the bug bounty manager cannot fix $P_k$, which is a genuine feature of bug discovery by humans. To maintain positive individual incentives, the manager should set an incremental reward such that $R_k \sim k^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha > 1.40$, which in turn would worsen the down-payment function both in terms of incremental expenditures and in exploration of higher ranks, not even considering possible individual human hard limits, when searching for additional bugs. In that latter case, setting higher reward incentives would have no effect.\\

Security researchers tend to switch from one bounty program to another program \cite{zhao2014exploratory,zhao2015empirical}. The strategy can be assimilated to portfolio diversification \cite{goetzmann2008equity}. Over all bug bounty programs, security researchers have another much more favorable expected payoff: The reward scaling is smaller ($R_{k} \sim k^{1.24}$ with $ p < 0.001$, $R^2 > 0.99$), yet the frequency of bounties decay much slower as a function of rank $P_{k} \sim k^{-1.05}$ ($ p < 0.001$, $R^2 = 0.85$). Therefore, over all bounty programs, security researchers have an increasing, yet marginally decreasing, incentive to explore higher ranks as $U_k \sim k^{0.19}$. In a nutshell, security researchers have an incentive to keep searching for bugs on a large variety of bug bounty programs. 

\subsection{Influence of Newly Launched Programs on Researcher Behaviors}
\label{ols}
As security researchers weigh their strategic choice to switch their attention from one program to another, the time factor is determinant because the expected payoff is dependent on the current vulnerability rank, which maps into the time dimension (i.e, the duration between two discoveries is drawn from a characteristic random variable, which is not considered here). While switching decision may be made by a researcher at any time, the most obvious moment is when a new program is being launched. Determining the power of attraction of a new program informs on the sudden incentive shift triggered by a punctual event. A number of factors may however influence this incentive shift: For example the notoriety of the organization launching a program in comparison to others may also influence the choices made by researchers. Here, we aim to test  3 hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf H1:} The number of newly launched programs is negatively associated with contributions to existing programs,
  \item {\bf H2:} Bounty rewards provided by newly launched programs is negatively associated with contributions to existing programs,
  \item {\bf H3: } The popularity of new launched programs influence negatively contributions to existing programs,
  \item {\bf H4:} The number of newly launched programs have a smaller impact on the contribution to older programs.
\end{itemize}


We use a simple ordinary least square (OLS) regression model, which is specified as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{reg_base}
V_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 dP_t + \beta_2 T_{it} + \beta_3 A_{it} + \beta_4 B_{it} + \epsilon_{it}.
\end{equation}
$V_{it}$ is the number of vulnerability reports received by bounty program $i$ in the month $t$. $dP_t$ is the number of new programs launched in month $t$. $T_{it}$ is the number of months since bounty program $i$ launched. We first incorporate $A_i$ the log of the Alexa rank, which measures web traffic  as a proxy of popularity for organization $i$. $B_i$ is the log of the average amount of bounty paid by bounty program $i$. Finally, $\epsilon_{it}$ is the unobservable error term. In models {\bf 2}-{\bf 4}, we extend the basic model to further study competition occurring between bounty programs. These alternative specifications include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Average bounty of newly launched programs:} Intuitively, if new programs offer higher bounties rewards, they should attract more researchers from existing programs. We calculate the average bounty for all new programs in month $t$ as $NB_t$.
  \item \textbf{Interaction between $dP_t$ and $T_{it}$:} Conceivably, the effect of new programs on existing programs depends on certain characteristics of the latter, such as age. In particular, we ask if a new entrant has more negative effects on older programs compared to younger programs? To examine this, we consider an interaction term between the number of new programs ($dP_t$) and the age of the program ($T_{it}$).
  \item \textbf{Program fixed effect:} To better control for program-specific, time-invariant characteristics, e.g., reputation among researchers, we add program fixed effect in model {\bf 4}. The addition of this fixed effect allows us to examine how bug discovery changes over time within each program $i$.

\noindent Consistent with our prediction, the coefficient of $dP_t$ is negative in all 4 specifications. Ceteris paribus, the launch of new programs reduces strongly the number of vulnerabilities reported to existing programs. In other words, the entry of new programs indeed attracts researcher's attention away from existing programs, which is consistent with fast decreasing expected payoff for individuals searching bugs for a specific program. Also, the average bounty paid by new programs ($B_{new,t}$) has a negative effect on existing programs as well, but the coefficient is only significant in model 4. Again this result is consistent with theory and above results, as researchers have a high incentive to find the low rank {\it low-hanging} fruits.\\

The interaction coefficients for term $T_{it} \times dP_t$ in models {\bf 3} and {\bf 4} are positive. Therefore, the impact of newly launched programs depends on the age of the existing programs: Compared to younger programs, the negative impact of $dP_t$ is smaller for programs with a longer history, i.e., those with larger $T_{it}$. At first sight, this results may look at odds with the fact that individual expected payoff from a specific program decreases as a function of rank $k$, and presumably the older a program the more likely it has a high rank. Thus, the switching effect should be stronger. Perhaps our OLS regression model is limited in the sense that it does account for the absolute activity, which decreases very slowly as $t \rightarrow \infty$ as shown on Figure \ref{timeline}B, instead of the variation rate.

% (\textbf{TODO}: We can also test the robustness of the model by trying about alternative dependent variables, such as the the number of researchers that have submitted at least one report to program $i$ in month $t$.)
